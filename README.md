The Game

A simple memory matching game. The user clicks two cards (images of memes) to try to match them. If there's a match, the cards disappear from the board. If there's no match, the cards are flipped back to their blank side so the user can try again.

The game consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Ideas for additional features:

A scoring mechanism
A timer
Add additional cards
Multi-player capabilities so you can compare scores
